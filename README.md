## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account for database hosting

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulcse129/My_Portfolio.git
cd My_Portfolio
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

* Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
```

* Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.*

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

*The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`.*

## 📦 API Endpoints

### Projects API

* `GET /api/projects` : Retrieve all projects
* `POST /api/projects` : Add a new project
* `DELETE /api/projects/:id` : Delete a project by ID

*Ensure that your frontend communicates with these endpoints appropriately.*

---

## 🧪 Testing the Application

1. **Add a Project**: Use the frontend interface to add a new project. Fill in the required details and submit the form.

2. **View Projects**: The added project should appear in the projects section dynamically.

3. **Delete a Project**: Use the delete button associated with a project to remove it from the list.

*Ensure that the backend server is running while performing these actions.*

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Implement user authentication for admin functionalities
* Add edit/update project feature
* Integrate image uploads for projects using services like Cloudinary
* Enhance the UI/UX with animations and transitions
